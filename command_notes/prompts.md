# Prompt Snippets (Komutan)

Keep short, reusable prompt snippets here for different AI agents.

Examples:

- Architect: "Read docs/architecture.md and docs/domain.md, then propose a plan for X."
- Builder: "Implement the plan in app/routes/main.py and app/templates, adding tests where needed."
- Refiner: "Review the diff and improve naming, error handling, and comments."
- DevOps: "Update infra/docker/Dockerfile and .github/workflows/tests.yml to support Python 3.11."

Add more as you find patterns that work well.
