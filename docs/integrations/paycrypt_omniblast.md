# Integration: PayCrypt & OmniBlast

This file is reserved for describing how the unified PayCrypt gateway integrates with
OmniBlast / related communication or marketing systems.

Ideas / hooks:

- Webhooks or events emitted when payments / withdrawals change status.
- APIs OmniBlast can call to pull aggregated metrics or client balances.
- Shared auth / API key model between systems.

Fill this out once the integration surface is better defined.
